This is a small program I use to apply a colourscheme to my Linux rice. It's
only really meant to be used by me but maybe the code will be useful to someone
else.<br>
If you look at the code and think it might actually be usable for you feel feel
free to use it but be careful.<br>
<br>
**It applies a colourscheme to the following programs:**<br>
- Foot<br>
- Fuzzel<br>
- Hyprland<br>
- Nvim<br>
- Waybar<br>

# Important:
**THIS WILL OVERWRITE STUFF IN YOUR .config FOLDER** be careful.<br>
<br>
For this program to work correctly your .config must be organized pretty much
exactly the same way as mine.<br>
(I will put my dots in another repo soon...)<br>

# Usage:
To use just run `python main.py` and choose a colourscheme.<br>
