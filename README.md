This is a small program I use to apply a colourscheme to my Linux rice.<br>
It's only really meant to be used by me but feel free to look at the code and
use if if you think it'll work for you.<br>
<br>
**It applies a colourscheme to the following programs:**<br>
Foot<br>
Fuzzel<br>
Hyprland<br>
Nvim<br>
Waybar<br>

# Important:
**THIS WILL OVERWRITE STUFF IN YOUR .config FOLDER** be careful.<br>
<br>
For this program to work correctly your .config must be organized pretty much
exactly the same way as mine. (I will put my dots in another repo soon...)<br>

# Usage:
To use just run `python main.py` and choose a colourscheme.<br>
